Alright you guys. 

#Yosemite notes

You have 3-4 days. Dedicate at least one full day bagging a peak in Tuolumne Meadows. Dedicate at least one full day to a hike in/around Yosemite Valley. Spend one day *not* doing an all-day hike, because the secrect to Yosemite is not having anything to do. Wander around in the meadow across the Swinging Bridge, or better yet, in front of El Cap. Eat an It's-It ice cream sandwich. Swim in the river. Take a nap. The more you do this, the better you are at Yosemite. If you have done all of these things, and you still have more days, decide what you like doing best, and spend one more day doing that.

Yosemite National Park is approximately 800 square miles; if I understand correctly it's larger than the state of Rhode Island. Look at these (maps)[https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/maps.htm] to understand the two areas that I will be focusing on: Yosemite Valley, and Tuolumne (pronounced: Too-ALL-Um-Knee) Meadows. The Valley is one of the highlights of the park, and the area it is most known for. Just seven miles long by a mile wide, it contains 90% of the visitors that will ever set foot in the Park. Here you will find Half Dome, El Capitan, and many waterfalls. Tuolumne Meadows is 45-60 minutes away from the valley, and almost a mile higher in elevation. Much less traveled (though it has it's busy moments) it is a wonderland of alpine meadows and snow-capped peaks. Both are worth visiting during your time here!

Sample itinerary:
1. 9/21: Arrive, check in, spend an hour or two hiking around Hetch Hetchy.
2. Yosemite Valley hike. Maybe the Valley Floor loop, maybe Half Dome.
3. Lazy day. Hike to the Tuolunme Grove, drive then drive on the the Valley, perhaps take a dip in the swimming hole, and then spend an afternoon sitting in a meadow.
4. Epic hike in Tuolunme. Eat at the Mobil.
5. Another shorter day hike in Tuolunme Meadows, then drive home. 

##To-do

###Whole day adventure choices

- [Mt.Dana](http://www.everytrail.com/guide/day-hike-to-mt-dana-) (a slightly easier scramble) This would take 3/4 of a day, an includes strenous hiking, some of it off-trail. It's Class 2, which means you never really need to use your hands to clamber over anything.

- [Mt. Conness](http://www.everytrail.com/guide/mount-conness)(a slightly more hairy scramble) This would take 3/4 day of a day, and includes strenuous hiking. It's Class 3, which means you should be prepared to use your hands and feet to scramble over blocks of rocks. It's not really a rock climb (that's Class 5) but it does mean you have to do both hiking *and* scrambling to reach the summit.

- (Valley Floor loop)[https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/valleylooptrail.htm] (Yosemite Valley) Hands-down the best hike in Yosemite Valley. Most of it sees little to no foot traffic. You will get amazing views of Half Dome, El Cap, Yosemite Falls, and all the famous tourist stuff. You will also get to sample both the south and north sides of the valley. A worthwhile extension is hiking to the base of El Capitan. The base of El Cap is a place that only climbers go, and it will give you a totally different perspective of the rock, standing right at the place where it comes out of the ground. You might meet some colorful characters.    

- (The Vernal Falls/Panorama/Fourmile Loop)[http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=1794585] Probably the best option if you want to hike to/through a waterfall. More crowded than anything else here, but not bad at all by New York standards. Do the hike by going up Vernal Falls, and coming down the Fourmile trail. You will also pass Nevada Falls (my fav) and Glacier Point (they sell food) as waypoints.

- (Half Dome)[http://www.everytrail.com/guide/half-dome-hike] The quintessentail Yosemite Valley hike. Long, dusty, and crowded. Still, the summit of Half Dome is unique in all the world. Permits are required. More info available (here)[https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm].


###Two-hour adventures

- Visit [Hetch Hetchy]. It's close to the Evergreen Lodge, it's often deserted, and it is at the centerpiece of the political history of the National Park Service--the debate over pure wilderness vs. utilitarian purpose. A whole other Yosemite Valley, but flooded and damned by the U.S. government. It's inception drove John Muir to despair, but it also is off the beaten track. No swimming here.

- (Ask-a-climber at El Cap Bridge)[https://www.yosemiteconservancy.org/visitor-services/ask-a-climber-2016] (Yosemite Valley) Tom Evans used to climb El Cap in the 60's and 70's, but these days he sets up a telescope on El Cap Bridge, pointing out climbers to anyone who cares to look, and telling stories about what it's like up on the wall. He used to do it out of his own passion; now his program is promoted by the Park.

- Swim in the Yosemite River (Lower Merced River Canyon) Park at the large pullout for (Cookie Cliff)[https://www.mountainproject.com/v/10---the-cookie-cliff/105863743] next to the Merced River. You should be able to look over the guardrail and see a huge boudler with a rope for climbing up the back of it. During times of low water (most Septembers) the rock is a great place to sun yourself, and it's a perfect 15' leap into the cool Merced river. (Look before you leap!) It's about 15 minutes from Yosemite Lodge, on the road to El Portal.

- Sitting the El Cap meadow at sunset (Yosemite Valley) Sit out in the meadow with a picnic lunch. I recommend parking by the bridge, then walking out into the meadow about 100 yards. As you watch the sky turn colors with the setting sun, tiny flecks of light will appear all over teh wall, and in the sky. These are the climbers sleeping up on the wall for the night.

- Sitting in a meadow during the afernoon (Yosemite Valley) There is a great meadow across for the Curry Village parking lot, another across the Swinging Bridge behind Yosemite Lodge, and a third by the bridge in front of El Capitan. Just lie there for an hour or two looking at the sky, and enjoy soaking up all the beauty.

- (The Mobil.)[http://www.whoanelliedeli.com/] Great food and community in an unbelievable setting. So much more than just a gas station. Drive here for dinner after a day in Tuolunme. 

- Wander around Tulunme Meadows. (This could easily turn into a whole-day activity. There are some good short hikes; I especially recommend scrambling to the top of (Lembert Dome)[http://www.everytrail.com/guide/lembert-dome]. For a moderate day, consider Cathedral Lake, or to turn up the volume even more, head to Vogelsang. (More info (here)[https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmhikes.htm]). 

- Big Trees. Hike through enoumous trees at the (Tuolunme Grove)[http://www.yosemitehikes.com/tioga-road/tuolumne-grove/tuolumne-grove.htm]. Keep in mind that the Mariposia Grove (at the other end of the park) is currently closed.


##Tips and tricks
- Do not feed the animals. Don't leave food lying around with your back turned. Defintely don't leave any food (even wrappers) in your car. Either a squirrel, a raven, or a bear will get into it. I am really good with food, and last time I was in the Valley a raven flew off with *a whole stick of butter* when I had my back turned for just a second. If you see a bear, as long as it's without cubs you can bang pots and pans, or do whatever to just scare it away. Only moutain lions are really dangerous, and they are few and far between in the parts of the park frequented by humans.

- On a rainy day. You should be so lucky! Definitely head to Yosemite Vally if it rains; Tuolumne will be too cold. Bring your camera! Storm clouds create amazing opportunites to photograph the park, and it is a special eerie feeling. Plus all the tourists usually stay home! You can go grab a hot cup of soup at the Mountain Room Bar in Yosemite Lodge when you are done. Get outside in bad weather, you won't regret it.

- Weekend traffic. It's bad, really bad. I recommend spending the weekend in the high country and the weekdays in the Valley, when it's not as bad. If you do want to visit Yosemite Valley on a Saturday or Sunday, consider parking at Yosemite Lodge and then either hiking or using the park shuttle bus to get around.

- Open containers. There's no open container law in the park, which is great if you want to enjoy a cold beer when you're sitting in the meadow, or have a glass of wine in the evening while you're watching one of the park's interpretive programs in the ampitheatre.

- Limited gas (Crane Flat). There's only one gas station on your way to Yosemite Valley and Tuolunme that I can think of, at (Crane Flat)[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crane+Flat+Gas+Station/@37.7530917,-119.7992314,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8096c2a3a5e0c111:0x43230bcf096f7420!8m2!3d37.7530917!4d-119.7970427]. Make sure you always stay above a quarter tank.

- Weather in the park can vary in September. Expect to be comfortable in short and a t-shirt in Yosemite Valley during the day. Temps are cooler in Toulumne, and while short sleeves and pants will work during the day, you will probably need a puffy or heavy fleece in the early morning or evening hours. 

- Always hike with a map and compass, especially if you are considering any of the off-trail scrambled in Tuolumne. Cell service is available in most (but not all) of Yosemite Valley. It's pretty spotty throughout the rest of the park. Having an extra cell battery pack might not be a bad idea.
