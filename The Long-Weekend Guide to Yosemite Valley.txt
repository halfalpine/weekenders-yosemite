Alright you guys. 

#Yosemite notes

You have 3-4 days. Dedicate at least one full day bagging a peak in Tuolumne Meadows. Dedicate at least one full day to a hike in/around Yosemite Valley. Spend one day *not* doing an all-day hike, because the secrect to Yosemite is not having anything to do. Wander around in the meadow across the Swinging Bridge, or better yet, in front of El Cap. Eat an It's-It. Swim in the river. Take a nap. The more you do this, the better you are at Yosemite. If you have done all of these thigns, and you still have more days, decide what you like doing best, and spend one more day doing that.

##To-do

###Whole day options
Mt.Dana (the smaller scramble
Mt. Conness (the bigger scramble

###Two-hour options:

- Visit [Hetch Hetchy]. It's close to the Evergreen Lodge, it's often deserted, and it is at the centerpiece of the political history of the National Park Service--the debate over pure wilderness vs. utilitarian purpose. A whole other Yosemite Valley, but flooded and damned by the U.S. government. It's inception drove John Muir to despair, but it also is off the beaten track. No swimming here.

- (Valley Floor loop) [https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/valleylooptrail.htm]. (11.5 mi) Hands-down the best hike in Yosemite Valley. Most of it sees little to no foot traffic. You will get amazing views of Half Dome, El Cap, Yosemite Falls, and all the famous tourist stuff. You will also get to sample both the south and north sides of the valley. There are at least two worthwhile extensions:
    -
